I'm an Astronomy PhD Candidate at Columbia University and the American Museum of Natural History 
supervised by [Dr. Ruth Angus](https://ruthangus.github.io/) and [Dr. Dan Foreman-Mackey](https://dfm.io/) working on problems at the intersection of astrophysics and statistical inference.

My research is in _computational data analysis_, where I work on figuring out how to do scientific inference in the presence of noisy data, and astronomy data is always noisy! I'm especially intersted in developing efficent statistical techniques with modern computational tools like [JAX](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/) to better understand stars and the planets that orbit them.
